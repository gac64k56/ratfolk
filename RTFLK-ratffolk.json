							"A common thread about Ratfolk communities is that they are seldom invited to set up shop by the locals. Most often a collection of them will simply and suddenly appear and then begin to nestle into dwellings as they please. These small self-contained communities are called mischiefs. Each mischief is a complex web of social bonds and hierarchies which shift as new Ratfolk arrive, others leave for some reason or other, strong leaders grow feeble, or as the whims of the group change without provocation.",
                            "Ratkin feel a strong need to be with others, either within an established mischief or with a group of close friends. A wandering Ratfolk will grow sad and long for the world if unable to find a community of some sort.",
                            "This need for companionship leads some Ratfolk struck by wanderlust to join up with groups of adventurers, with who they will forge a deep bond. While a tired idiom to many, for these Ratfolk the real treasure are the friends and stories they made along the way."

							"Spirituality is a complex subject for Ratfolk. Typically a local mischief will adopt similar faith practices to the communities they are closest to.",
                            "However, in addition to this worship each mischief also harbors belief in an entity known simply as the Swarmhead. Belief in this entity seems to inevitably and organically creep into the belief system of every Ratfolk group. Mischiefs totally isolated from each other seem to have an uncanny spiritual congruence.",
                            "Some claim it is a great cosmic rat which cares for each Ratfolk individually, waiting for the right time to lead the swarms to paradise. Others claim it to be not an individual but the collective willpower of a rising tide of vermin which will one day engulf all that ratkind has touched. For as many mischiefs of Ratfolk exist, there are just as many beliefs about the nature, intentions, and purpose of the Swarmhead."

Ratfolk who seem content to set up a shop of curiosities, a small work bench, or an ecclectic habidashery and earn their coin with their hands. These are the Pack Rats.",
                            "Less common is for a small mischief of Pack Rats to travel as a caravan, each laden with wares, raw materials, and crafting equipment. While rare, these Pack Rats are vital to the greater Ratfolk community as they form the social strands that connect the various mischiefs strewn about here and there. Along with trade goods the Pack Rat brings with them the invaluable commodity of news and information."
